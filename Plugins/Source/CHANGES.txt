1.2.3-alpha5 (not released yet)
- [FR]: When re-docking restrict attaching to the non-compatible docking ports, and highlight the compatible ones.
- [Fix]: Cursor hints could work incorrectly when only cursor status was supplied.
- [Fix]: Handle wrong assemblies that could have created due to a bug in the KSP editor.
- [Fix]: Don't check parts count when working with inventory in editor. It could cause an error and block parts dragging.
- [FR]: When stack attaching only consider nodes that don't allow collisions.

1.2.3-alpha4 (28 December 2015)
- [FR]: Add a background when showing cursor status and hit text.
- [FR] #96: Allow move/attach a group of parts. When grab mode is selected the whole hierarchy is highlited.
- [Fix]: Don't equip items when loading non-eva kerbal. When vessel has multiple non-engineer kerbals, and there is one with an equipped screwdriwer an error "cannot quip" was showing on load.
- [Fix] #97: Accept names with dots when overriding part settings in config. E.g. "mumech_MJ2_AR202" is correctly tarnslated into "mumech.MJ2.AR202".
- [Fix] #87: Correctly handle "revert flight" action, and stop adding multiple callbacks that slow down editor UI.
- [FR]: New mode "Re-dock" (shortcut: "y") - allows moving vessels docked to the station. No need to snipe the right part to deatch, the right docking port is found automatically.
- ReFactoring: Added new KSP_Dev module to make development logging more simple and useful. Allows wrapping methods with exception handlers and setting logging level/filters via a config file located in KSP_Dev/settings.cfg file.
- ReFactoring: Wrap many (but not all) Unity callback methods into exception handlers via KSP_Dev.
- ReFactoring: Many style and comments changes which don't affect functionality.

Version 1.2.3 (11 November 2015):
