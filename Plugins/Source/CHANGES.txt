Alpha changes since last release:
- [Change] IMPORTANT! Deprecate dragging parts from the editor's category list
  via a left mouse button. Untity 5 uses this event to start "drag-n-scroll"
  event, and overriding this behavior doesn't look a good idea. Now, KIS reacts
  only to Alt+Right click to grab a part from the editor's category list.
  Between KIS invetories parts still can be moved using usual left mosue button
  drag behavior.

Alpha 2:
- [Enhancement] Add new setting in the config to specify key modifiers that
  activate dragging in editor category list. By defaul it's set to None which
  preserves same behavior as in 1.0.5.
- [Internal] Improve vesion tags to vetter identify KIS target and version.
- [Internal] Add KSP dependency to KSPDev_Utils 0.10.
