Pre-release changes:
- [Fix] #117: Fix duplication of the default items on flight revert.
- [Fix] #140: A part get created on drag in the editor.
- [Internal] Move TweakScale and volume override support in a single place.
- [Change] Always calculate part volume from its prefab. It's now consistent but may be not optimal in some cases. E.g. deployable parts that are deployed by default (in the mesh state) will take more space than they used to be. It may result in awkward behavior of containers that were loaded prior to the update.
- [Internal] Fix null fields in the modules to make part snapshot working fine.
- [Internal] Simulate awakening of the new KIS modules. It's required to not fail snapshoting.
- [Change] Add a ModuleManager patch to override stock drills volume since in prefab these parts are deployed and take too much space.
- [Fix] #141: Stop directly modifying inventory part mass.
- [Internal] Use unified code to calcualte part's scale.
- [Enhancement] #148: Dropped parts get weird names.
- [Fix] #147: Some parts don't give usable drag models from prefab.
- [Fix] #145: Carriable items show as "carried" in the inventory.
- [Fix] #142: Settings are always read from file.
- [Fix] #137: Volume of Drill-O-Matic calculated incorrectly.
