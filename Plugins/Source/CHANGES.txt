Pre-release changes:
- [Fix] #121: In node attach mode the connection points markers get overlapped by the part's mesh.
- [Fix] #122: For some parts attach point is wrongly detected.
- [Change] When attaching a part with stack nodes by default prefer "bottom" and "top" attach nodes as they are most used ones.
- [Fix] #124: Parts with allowPartAttach = 1 still require a tool.
- [Change] Turn allowPartAttach and allowStaticAttach fields of KISItem into enums. Integers are still accepted but in the new parts using of enum names is encouraged.
- [Enhancement] Show error messag when "X" is pressed and no item is equipped.
