Alpha changes since last release:
- [Change] IMPORTANT! Deprecate dragging parts from the editor's category list
  via a left mouse button. Untity 5 uses this event to start "drag-n-scroll"
  event, and overriding this behavior doesn't look a good idea. Now, KIS reacts
  only to Alt+Right click to grab a part from the editor's category list.
  Between KIS invetories parts still can be moved using usual left mosue button
  drag behavior.

Alpha 2:
- [Enhancement] Add new setting in the config to specify key modifiers that
  activate dragging in editor category list. By defaul it's set to None which
  preserves same behavior as in 1.0.5.
- [Internal] Improve vesion tags to better specify KIS target and version.
- [Internal] Add KSP dependency to KSPDev_Utils 0.10.

Alpha 3:
- [Enhancement] Improved search tags and descriptions in parts.
- [Internal] Migrate from `Part.rb` to `Part.Rigidbody` to handle parts with no rigidbody (e.g. radial adapter).
- [Fix] Parts got replicated and attachment didn't work when surface attaching parts onto radial adapter.

Alpha 4 (candidate):
- [Internal] Report mod's version when showing pre-release warning.
- [Internal] Fix cimpiling for vuild KSP 1.1.1209.
- [Enhancement] Minor descriptions changes in the parts.
- [Fix] React on joint break on static attached items.
- [Internal] When attaching static part from inventory wait till it's started.
