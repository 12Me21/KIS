This folder holds the classes that are subject to move into the
[KPSDev Util](https://github.com/ihsoft/KSPDev/tree/master/Sources/Utils).
The trunk is expected to always have this folder empty. However, the dev branches
may have modules here. If you do a release, *ensure* all the modules are moved into
the Utils, and the appropriate version is checked out for KIS.
